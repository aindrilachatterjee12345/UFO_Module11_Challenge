# UFO_Module11_Challenge
Module 11 Challenge 
# Purpose of the project
The webpage and dynamic table Dana has built are working as intended, but Dana has decided she would like the table to be filtered even further. While it currently filters by the date, she would like to include the ability to filter by more column headers. The ability to pinpoint a search by date and country, for example, would go a long way in providing more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings.

# Technologies used
The webpage needed to be professionally designed using HTML and CSS. Interactivity needed to be added with Javascript and D3. D3 is a useful javascript library for working with data-driven websites. A table of UFO sitings needed to be added to the site along with filtering capability to filter on the various columns.

# Recommendation 
My recommendation for further development would include removing the button to filter and instead have the table update automatically on change of a filtered value. In addition it would be ideal to add pagination to the table in case our results grow in size.The other recommendation for improving this webpage would be to clean the data in the "Duration" column. As it stands, there is no standard format for the reporting of UFO sighting duration, and there are typos and inconsistent abbreviations for units of time. By cleaning this data up, we would be able to filter by duration as well.
